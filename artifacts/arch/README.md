High Level Architecture: 
- 1️⃣ OpenAPI Schema Analysis → Parses OpenAPI specs, extracts endpoints, handles references.
- 2️⃣ LLM-Powered Test Generation → Uses an LLM (via Ollama) to create meaningful test cases.
- 3️⃣ Smart Mock Data Generation → Generates context-aware test data dynamically.
- 4️⃣ Test Execution Engine → Runs the tests against APIs and collects results.
- 5️⃣ Self-Healing Mechanism → Analyzes failures and refines test cases iteratively.
